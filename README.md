# Animated Header React.js Component

This is a simple animated header React.js component that utilizes only CSS for animations. I created this component as a practice to enhance my CSS skills.

## Inspiration

The code for this component is inspired by a tutorial by [Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode) on YouTube. The original tutorial was for HTML and CSS, but I adapted it to a React.js component as a learning exercise and to potentially use it in future projects.
